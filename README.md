You can locate and view my wireframe design in the "Wireframe" folder, which has all of the designs for how I wanted my webpages to be laid up.

My stylesheet may be found in the "CSS" folder, which aids in the design of websites which include normalize.css that help to set everything to default follow by using styles.css to utilizing my own styles that I wanted.

In the "Image" folder which inculde the icon image from spotify websites.

Finally, under the "Javascript" folder is the Javascript code which will run for login.html, RegisterPage.html, login.html and membership.html to membership-4.html
# Features
